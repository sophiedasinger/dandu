As they explained, there was no school within many miles, which meant that many of their children remained illiterate, and those who were sent to far-off schools struggled because of the hours they spent daily walking to and from Dandu.  We realized that, with donors to support the cost of building materials, our partner International Partnership for Human Development (WEBSITE LINK), could help Dandu achieve their goal to build a school.</p>"; }

Our donors came in all shapes and sizes, but we all wanted to help these good people get the school they were so desperate for. When the research team visited Dandu after fundraising had been achieved, the villagers were ecstatic! We took the opportunity to ask them what they wanted to achieve, and learned that they are very ambitious for their children, with hopes for them learning Portuguese, English, mathematics, science, and “all things necessary for a good education”. The younger parents, also, hope it may be possible for vocational training in things such as childcare, farming and skills that may help them earn money to support their families better.</p>';}

	document.getElementById('description').innerHTML = '<h2>IPHD led the construction.</h2><p> IPHD specializes in helping villagers build schools. Their philosophy is: we help, but you do. First of all, they went to Dandu and talked to the villagers about the process, and helped identify suitable land. The Sise family then donated this land to the village and a legal document drawn up so that the school would belong to the village. After that, IPHD staff visited regularly and explained each step and provided materials. The project became an all-village project, and when some steps seemed hard, there were even some out-of-town visitors to lend a hand. A foundation needed nothing but help laying out a suitable plan and village men to dig the trenches. Cement and building block molds, combined with a great deal of water, led to bricks Bricks led to walls Walls led to windows and roof frames, read for the final steps<p>';}

It has three classrooms for Grades 1-3, and 3 teachers provided by the Ministry of Education. As yet the school is bare and needs cement to complete the walls, but Dandu succeeded in this huge milestone of getting a school, and 150 children are attending classes.<p>'; }
